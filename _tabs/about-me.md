Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chris Lovejoy. My story so far:

## Short Version

- 2011 - 2017: Studied Medicine at Cambridge University, dabbling in research, statistics and teaching
- 2017 - 2019: Worked as a doctor and at a healthtech start-up (at intersection of healthcare and AI)
- 2019 - 2021: Did a master's degree in machine learning and worked in industry as a data scientist
- Sep 2021 - Dec 2022: Founded a company (health data infra), raised investment
- Jan 2023 - Aug 2023: AI consultant and solopreneur / indie hacker
- Aug 2023 - now: Founding team at [Anterior](http://www.anterior.com), building an AI clinical brain

## Longer Version (reverse chronological)

### Building a Clinical Brain *(Aug 2023 - Now)*
In Progress


### Consulting and Bottom-Up Entrepreneurship *(Jan 2023 - Aug 2023)*
I divided my time between [independent consulting](./services) and building [[52 startups in 52 weeks|fun projects that could become businesses]]. I built up my savings while hanging out a bunch with my kid, but started to miss working in a team towards a bigger picture objective.

My approach was to [[Im now building in public - 2023-01|build in public]] and to focus on what I call "bottom-up" enterpreneurship rather than a more "top-down" approach I took during my first start-up. <!-- TODO: update to more fleshed out article--> 


### Top-Down Entrepreneurship *(Sept 2021 - Dec 2022)*
In 2021, I started a company to accelerate the transition towards patient-owned health data, and the benefits that would enable. We received financial investment and support from [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com), [AAVE](https://aave.com), [Oasis Labs](https://www.oasislabs.com), amongst others. I gave it a good go, learnt a lot but ultimately stopped working on the project in December. The vision was great but the technology for decentralised storage of health data is just not there yet. <!-- One limiting factor was that the current ecosystem for decentralised storage of data is still maturing (and not really ready for the challenges health data storage presents).--> <!-- TODO: write article on learnings and update link here -->


### Deep-dive Machine Learning *(Aug 2019 - Aug 2021)*
I did a Master's Degree in Data Science and Machine Learning at University College London. I wanted to explore my interest in maths, plus build a more concrete skillset outside of clinical medicine. I absolutely loved it, and ended up scoring well. My favourite modules were Natural Language Processing, Computational Biology and Reinforcement Learning.

I also worked various roles in industry as a data scientist and machine learning engineer. <!-- TODO: expand on this --> 

I decided to share my learnings as I went along, which ended up as [[Machine Learning for Healthcare - The Online Course|an online course]], [various articles](https://www.chrislovejoy.me/writing)<!-- TODO: update this link to specific ML healthcare tag --> and with me becoming a lecturer at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/health-informatics/machine-learning-healthcare) and later at [Imperial College London](./imperial).

<!-- TODO: I could mention ETP here --> 

### Doctoring and Beyond *(Aug 2017 - Aug 2019)*
I worked as a doctor in London from 2017 and gained full registration and license to practice. I wasn't fully satisfied with medicine, so did some [[My winding, unplanned path from Doctor to AI Startups (and all the steps in between)|high-speed career sampling]]. During this period, I also:
- led a small team at Cera Care and built a predictive AI model (for clinical deterioration), which helped us raise [Â£54 million](https://www.homecareinsight.co.uk/cera-care-raises-54m-to-fund-expansion-and-smartcare-roll-out/).
- completed an MBA with the [Quantic School of Business and Technology](https://quantic.edu/mba/)
- wrote and published a book for sharing experiences, reflections and advice for learning medicine ([Gumroad](https://chrislovejoy.gumroad.com/l/medstudentmanual), [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2HFGoQY), [Waterstones](https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-ultimate-guide-to-being-a-medical-student/chris-lovejoy//9781912557417))


### Studying Medicine and Experimenting *(Sept 2011 - Aug 2017)*
I studied Medicine at the University of Cambridge (UK) from 2011 until 2017. I experimented a bunch outside this, including:
- Playing basketball for the university 1st and 2nd teams
- Acting in a few plays at the Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club
<!-- TODO: add a bunch more here-->


<!--## Pre-Sept 2011
- Growing up, I loved [playing music] - consider adding this section later-->
