Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chris Lovejoy. My story so far:

## Short Version

- 2011-2017: Studied Medicine at Cambridge University, dabbling in research, statistics and teaching
- 2017-2019: Worked as a doctor and at a healthtech start-up (at intersection of healthcare and AI)
- 2019-2021: Did a master's degree in machine learning and worked in industry as a data scientist
- 2021-2022: Started my own start-up, raised investment
- 2023: Left that start-up, now building something new and freelancing ([[Services|building AI models using health data]])

## Longer Version (reverse chronological)

### Bottom-Up Entrepreneurship *(Jan 2023 - Now)*
My focus right now is on [[Im now building in public - 2023-01|building things in public]]. I switched my focus from [[Top-down vs bottom-up entrepreneurship|"top-down" to "ground-up" entrepreneurship]]. <!-- TODO: update to more fleshed out article--> I'm dividing my time between [freelancing](./services) and building [[52 startups in 52 weeks|fun projects that I hope can become businesses]].


### Top-Down Entrepreneurship *(Sept 2021 - Dec 2022)*
In 2021, I started a company to accelerate the transition towards patient-owned health data, and the benefits that would enable. We received financial investment and support from [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com), [AAVE](https://aave.com), [Oasis Labs](https://www.oasislabs.com), amongst others. I gave it a good go, learnt a lot but ultimately stopped working on the project in December. One limiting factor was that the current ecosystem for decentralised storage of data is still maturing (and not really ready for the challenges health data storage presents).  <!-- TODO: write article on learnings and update link here -->


### Deep-dive Machine Learning *(Aug 2019 - Aug 2021)*
I did a Master's Degree in Data Science and Machine Learning at University College London. I wanted to explore my interest in maths, plus build a more concrete skillset outside of clinical medicine. I absolutely loved it, and ended up scoring well. My favourite modules were Natural Language Processing, Computational Biology and Reinforcement Learning.

I also worked various roles in industry as a data scientist and machine learning engineer. <!-- TODO: expand on this --> 

I decided to share my learnings as I went along, which ended up as [[Machine Learning for Healthcare - The Online Course|an online course]], [various articles](https://www.chrislovejoy.me/writing)<!-- TODO: update this link to specific ML healthcare tag --> and with me becoming a lecturer at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/health-informatics/machine-learning-healthcare) and later at [Imperial College London](./imperial).

<!-- TODO: I could mention ETP here --> 

### Doctoring and Beyond *(Aug 2017 - Aug 2019)*
I worked as a doctor in London from 2017 and gained full registration and license to practice. I wasn't fully satisfied with medicine, so did some [[Career paths I considered when leaving medicine|high-speed career sampling]]. During this period, I also:
- led a small team at Cera Care and built a predictive AI model (for clinical deterioration), which helped us raise [Â£54 million](https://www.homecareinsight.co.uk/cera-care-raises-54m-to-fund-expansion-and-smartcare-roll-out/).
- completed an MBA with the [Quantic School of Business and Technology](https://quantic.edu/mba/)
- wrote and published a book for sharing experiences, reflections and advice for learning medicine ([Gumroad](https://chrislovejoy.gumroad.com/l/medstudentmanual), [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2HFGoQY), [Waterstones](https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-ultimate-guide-to-being-a-medical-student/chris-lovejoy//9781912557417))


### Studying Medicine and Experimenting *(Sept 2011 - Aug 2017)*
I studied Medicine at the University of Cambridge (UK) from 2011 until 2017. I experimented a bunch outside this, including:
- Playing basketball for the university 1st and 2nd teams
- Acting in a few plays at the Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club
<!-- TODO: add a bunch more here-->


<!--## Pre-Sept 2011
- Growing up, I loved [playing music] - consider adding this section later-->
