### My background is not like many others

I spent 8 years studying medicine and working as a doctor in Cambridge and London - before fully switching to AI in 2019. Since then I've worked across the spectrum, from [cutting-edge research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g3MOrpcAAAAJ) to AI-powered products affecting millions.

I've led >20 projects at the cutting edge of AI in healthcare. My mandate has always been: *AI technology has improved - how can we apply this to healthcare in a safe and effective way, which meaningfully improves patients/customers*

In the last 2 years AI capability has improved beyond a point that many never thought it would reach.

I know what it takes to go from theory to real-world impact. Rather than telling you about the latest shiny new models, I'll guide you towards practical solutions:
- Create simple baselines
- Focus on simple systems
- Prioritise business and patient outcomes

This pragmatic approach has been at the core of the following:
- Buidling a clinical decision making system used by US healthcare insurers that cover 10s of millions of lives (at [Anterior](https://anterior.com/))
- Building algorithms to predict clinical need, enabling the safer delivery of home care (at [Cera Care](https://ceracare.co.uk/)) 
- Building the first model to accurately predict blood glucose from non-invasive measurements (at [ZOE](https://zoe.com/))

### How best to work with me

There are three ways to work with me:
1. **Subscription model**: Includes a 45-minute meeting each week, unlimited email/slack access, and my network of experts.
2. **Project-based engagement**: We will tackle a specific initiative with a fixed scope and budget. This includes helping you do research, write code, set up systems, and anything else you need.
3. **Traditional consulting relationship**: We meet every week to discuss strategy, planning, and execution. I may bring in extra staff.


If you'd like to engage me as an individual, rather than as a company, I also offer the following:
- **Career coaching**: Navigating a career change in the AI/LLM space, particularly for those from a health-related background
- **Technical mentorship**: Understanding technical aspects of ML/AI and how to incorporate it into your current work


If you're not interested in consulting at the moment, I suggest reading my [articles](https://www.chrislovejoy.me/ml4h) or checking out my [course on applying ML to healthcare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj_mF4OlcUY&list=PLZz4IsmMUFBxfuW059IEdqtPuytFG-vae&index=1).
