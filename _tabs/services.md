### My background is not like many others

I spent 8 years studying medicine and working as a doctor in Cambridge and London, before moving to AI full-time in 2019. Since then I've worked across the spectrum, from [cutting-edge research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g3MOrpcAAAAJ) to AI-powered products affecting millions.

I've used my medical background to figure out how we should be incorporating domain expertise into AI products (initially in healthcare, then beyond). I've built pragmatic evaluation systems, which are essential for mission-critical industries like healthcare.

I've led >20 projects at the cutting edge of AI in healthcare. My mandate has always been: *AI can now do X - how can we use this to solve a real pain point, while proving and maintaining a strong performance over time*.

In the last 2 years, AI capability has improved beyond a point that many never thought it would reach. As part of the founding team at [Anterior](https://www.anterior.com/news/anterior-raises-series-a), I've been at the forefront of that change. 

I know what it takes to go from theory to real-world impact. Rather than telling you about the latest shiny new models, I'll guide you towards practical solutions:
- Create simple baselines
- Focus on simple systems
- Prioritise business outcomes

This pragmatic approach has been at the core of the following:
- Building a clinical decision making system used by US healthcare insurers that cover 10s of millions of lives (at [Anterior](https://www.anterior.com/news/anterior-raises-series-a))
- Building algorithms to predict clinical need, enabling the safer delivery of home care (at [Cera Care](https://sifted.eu/articles/cera-biggest-elderly-care-round)) 
- Building the first model to accurately predict blood glucose from non-invasive measurements (at [ZOE](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/30/nutrition-microbiome-zoe/))

### How best to work with me

There are three ways to work with me:
1. **Subscription model**: Includes a 45-minute meeting each week, unlimited email/slack access, and my network of experts.
2. **Project-based engagement**: We will tackle a specific initiative with a fixed scope and budget. This includes helping you do research, write code, set up systems, and anything else you need.
3. **Traditional consulting relationship**: We meet every week to discuss strategy, planning, and execution. I may bring in extra staff.


If you'd like to engage me as an individual, rather than as a company, I also offer the following:
- **Career coaching**: Navigating a career change in the AI/LLM space, particularly for those from a health-related background
- **Technical mentorship**: Understanding technical aspects of ML/AI and how to incorporate it into your current work


If you're not interested in consulting at the moment, I suggest reading my [articles](https://www.chrislovejoy.me/ml4h) or checking out my [course on applying ML to healthcare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj_mF4OlcUY&list=PLZz4IsmMUFBxfuW059IEdqtPuytFG-vae&index=1).
