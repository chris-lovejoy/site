While studying at Cambridge University medical school between 2011 and 2017, I kept a blog to record my experiences and reflections related to medicine. A selection of these are available [here](/writing).

After graduating, while working as a junior doctor, I wrote and published a book called **_[“The Modern Medical Student Manual”](https://3285439487322.gumroad.com/l/medstudentmanual)_**. It initially started out as a short guide for my sister, who was about to start medical school, but evolved into something more substantial.

The eBook can be downloaded for free [here](https://chrislovejoy.gumroad.com/l/medstudentmanual), while a paperback copy can be bought from [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2HFGoQY) or [Waterstones](https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-ultimate-guide-to-being-a-medical-student/chris-lovejoy//9781912557417). A more detailed description of the book is available [here](/book). The below video discusses many of the ideas in the book:

I have also recorded a series of videos outlining my approach to studying, for a general audience, which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3a3fE2ze64&list=PLZz4IsmMUFByHfyiNVZPV324naSMVq90T).
