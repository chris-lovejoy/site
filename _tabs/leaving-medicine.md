Okay, so you've [[Learning medicine|learnt or are learning medicine]]. Now you're not sure whether you want to be a full-time doctor for ever. What should you do?

It depends which category you fall into:
1. **Practicing clinical medicine and content** -- but curious about what's out there and what skills could be helpful within your medical career -> read [this](/leaving-medicine#should-i-be-thinking-about-leaving-medicine)
2. **Practicing clinical medicine and disgruntled** -- interesting in leaving but not too sure what that would look like or how -> read [this](/leaving-medicine#discovering-what-exists-outside-of-clinical-medicine)
3. **Working towards leaving full-time clinical medicine** -- have an initial plan but haven't yet "taken the leap" -> read [this](/leaving-medicine#how-to-carve-your-path-out-of-full-time-medicine)
4. **Have a clear vision of how you're leaving full-time medicine** -- and have taken concrete steps towards it -> read [this](/leaving-medicine#how-to-carve-your-path-out-of-full-time-medicine)

## Should I be thinking about "leaving medicine"?

potential articles to write:
- does "leaving medicine" mean leaving medicine? -> why exploring other options may solidify your medical standing (ie. give you valuable skills to combine with medicine)
    - doesn't need to be either-or -- you may be able to combine stuff
    - just exploring stuff can be helpful - even if you stay in medicine
    - (if you just want to stay in medicine, it's completely cool! actually, even beter for having explored stuff)
- all jobs suck a bit - there is no nirvana
    - pick a job for the bread, not just the jam
    - (don't buy into eg. social media influencers telling you everything is perfect)
- why your career should excite you -- and it's increasingly possible for this to be true in 2025 / the age of AI
    - previous generation which was conservative - wanted to stay in a safe job - basically a contract between you and your employer (you're committed, and they'll take care of you financially)
    - but now you can learn anything, less gate-keeping eg. based on degrees, jobs are less secure -> you can now chart your own own path if you want to (and I think you should)

## Discovering what exists outside of clinical medicine

there's really a ton of different stuff you can do. In my case, I followed a [windy, unplanned path - article].


potential articles to write:
- frameworks for deciding what career you want to do
    - resources you can use, eg. 80,000 hours
    - about meta approach of trying to figure out a career that matches your skills and wants. (but also that sometimes should just focus on skills and see what happens)
    - talk to people 3-5 years ahead of you
- common and uncommon paths to combine with (or do instead of) medicine [(with examples of people who've done each?)]
    - common
        - research, management consulting, (public health?)
    - uncommon
        - SWE, data scientist, start-ups


I took the ML route - if that's interesting for you:
- article: How might you use machine learning in a medical career?
- article: Why machine learning? Why medicine? Why the hype?

## How to carve your path (out of full-time medicine)


potential articles to write:
- how to grow career capital and escape a job you don't like
    - build skillset that are generally valuable
    - make a portfolio online
- the most important meta skills and how to learn them
    - self-education: [my fast learning articles from MMSM]
    - communication: [from article: commanding clearer communiation]
    - writing: [articles I've written about that?]
    - thinking (article: scientific approach to research)
    - business: [article: How to understand the business world (and why I did MBA)]
- (create a timeline for leaving medicine)
    - (bear in mind it can take time. don't expect it to happen overnight. you probably don't actually have that many skills that the market cares about if you've just been doing medicine)
    - an important step is landing first job outside of medicine -> that's a big threshold. so identify what that could be and work backwards(?)   
- meta approaches for leaving medicine
    - taking little bits (to discover what you like AND build skills)
    - grow your career capital



### Getting into AI, programming, tech, start-ups
If you're specifically interested in the tech start-ups, programming and AI (which is the path I took), here are some relevant articles I've written:

[perhaps just linking to a relevant tag or combination of tags, which includes all the below]
- article: Resources for building the foundational understanding of machine learning
- article: Beginner to data scientist in 25 months: every project and what I learnt
- article: learn to code through projects
- article: the busy person's guide to building technical data science skills
- article: learning AI - where to start in 2024

## I'm out of medicine.. now what?

You probably know your next steps better than I do! Best of luck :)

possible article:
- "so... am I still a doctor?" [something reflective about identity and change]
