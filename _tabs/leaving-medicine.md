2. Practicing clinical medicine and disgruntled -- interesting in leaving but not too sure what that would look like or how -> read this
3. Working towards leaving clinical medicine -- have an initial plan but haven't yet "taken the leap" -> read this
4. Have a clear vision of what you want to do and have taken concrete steps towards it -> read this

## Should I be thinking about "leaving medicine"?

- doesn't need to be either / or. you may be able to combine stuff
- just exploring stuff can be helpful - even if you stay in medicine

- (there's a meta trend here, of jobs becoming less safe, uncoupling of skills, etc -- everybody's an enterpreneur)

- (if you just want to stay in medicine, it's completely cool! actually, even beter for having explored stuff)
