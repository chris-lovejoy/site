Okay, so you've [[medicine|learnt or are learning medicine]]. Now you're not sure whether you want to be a full-time doctor for ever. What should you do?

It depends which category you fall into:
1. **Practicing clinical medicine and content** -- but curious about what's out there and what skills could be helpful within your medical career -> read [this](/leaving-medicine#should-i-be-thinking-about-leaving-medicine)
2. **Practicing clinical medicine and disgruntled** -- interesting in leaving but not too sure what that would look like or how -> read [this](/leaving-medicine#discovering-what-exists-outside-of-clinical-medicine)
3. **Working towards leaving full-time clinical medicine** -- have an initial plan but haven't yet "taken the leap" -> read [this](/leaving-medicine#how-to-carve-your-path-out-of-full-time-medicine)
4. **Have a clear vision of how you're leaving full-time medicine** -- and have taken concrete steps towards it -> read [this](/leaving-medicine#how-to-carve-your-path-out-of-full-time-medicine)

## Should I be thinking about "leaving medicine"?

articles to write:
- does "leaving medicine" mean leaving medicine? -> why exploring other options may solidify your medical standing
    - doesn't need to be either / or. you may be able to combine stuff
    - just exploring stuff can be helpful - even if you stay in medicine
    - (if you just want to stay in medicine, it's completely cool! actually, even beter for having explored stuff)
- all jobs suck a bit - there is no nirvana
    - pick a job for the bread, not just the jam
    - (don't buy into eg. social media influencers telling you everything is perfect)
- why your career should excite you -- and it's increasingly possible for this to be true in 2025 / the age of AI
    - previous generation which was conservative - wanted to stay in a safe job - basically a contract between you and your employer (you're committed, and they'll take care of you financially)
    - but now you can learn anything, less gate-keeping eg. based on degrees, jobs are less secure -> you can now chart your own own path if you want to (and I think you should)
