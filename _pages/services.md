If you're an organization leader seeking to generate real-world value with AI, particularly in healthcare, I'd love to help. My experience includes:
- 9 years training as a doctor then 7 years building AI powered products. I've seen the evolution from traditional ML approaches to LLM-powered paradigms and helped build the playbook for doing so in healthcare.
- building evaluation systems that unlock reliable and safe AI, supporting AI's use in mission-critical industries like healthcare and enabling companies to prove performance for regulatory compliance
- setting up teams, tools and processes to bake domain expertise into AI systems

I can guide you through the challenges of AI product development, ensuring your team is set up to move fast, leverage new technology effectively and differentiate you from competitors.

## Building AI products in 2026 requires a fundamentally different approach

The arrival of LLMs has created unprecedented opportunities in healthcare AI - but also new challenges that many teams are struggling to fully capitalise upon.

I see three critical challenges holding teams back:

#### 1. **The MVP-to-production chasm**

We've seen how easy it is to make an impressive demo - and how hard it is to deploy something that provides real-world value. In mission-critical industries like healthcare, the bar needs to be high.

I help teams design pragmatic evaluations, tailored to their stage of product development, to enable targetted iteration, achieve safe and effective performance and then maintain it through robust post-deployment monitoring. I've built systems that [have achieved state-of-the-art performance and delighted healthcare users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ5ZJy19KMo).


#### 2. **Domain expertise matters more than ever**

With LLMs, words are the new code. Your prompts, instructions, and evaluation criteria are now core parts of your system - and you need a way to systematically bake in the insights from those who deeply understand the domain.

Domain experts and engineers often speak different langauges - and traditional software development workflows weren't designed for this new collaborative paradigm.

I help teams bridge this gap. As a doctor by background who's spent years building AI systems, I understand both worlds. I've designed workflows, tools and processes [to convert domain expertise into domain expert LLM applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs). 


#### 3. **Companies are building with yesterday's playbook**

The approach that made sense in the "pre-LLM" era doesn't work any more. Yet that was only 3 years ago and many companies haven't caught up.

LLM-powered products require new skillsets and new approaches: context engineering, workflow decomposition and evaluation systems - rather than feature engineering, model architecture design and optimizing for model accuracy. 

Those best placed to execute the new playbook are those who've lived through its evolution. I operated in this 'pre-LLM' world; I built state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and published [the first study to compare AI and doctors](https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m689.abstract). I then spent 2 years building LLM-powered products for healthcare admin at a [Sequoia-backed start-up](https://www.anterior.com/insights/company-news/anterior-secures-usd20-million-series-a-to-unlock-administrative-efficiencies-for-healthcare).

I help teams build in an LLM-native way; in how they architect their applications and write code, in how they hire and train their staff and in their operational proceses.


<!-- ### My background is not like many others

I spent 8 years studying medicine and working as a doctor in Cambridge and London, before moving to AI full-time in 2019. Since then I've worked across the spectrum, from [cutting-edge research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g3MOrpcAAAAJ) to AI-powered products affecting millions.

I've used my medical background to figure out how we should be incorporating domain expertise into AI products (initially in healthcare, then beyond). I've built pragmatic evaluation systems, which are essential for mission-critical industries like healthcare.

I've led >20 projects at the cutting edge of AI in healthcare. My mandate has always been: *AI can now do X - how can we use this to solve a real pain point, while proving and maintaining a strong performance over time*.

In the last 2 years, AI capability has improved beyond a point that many never thought it would reach. As part of the founding team at [Anterior](https://www.anterior.com/news/anterior-raises-series-a), I've been at the forefront of that change. 

I know what it takes to go from theory to real-world impact. Rather than telling you about the latest shiny new models, I'll guide you towards practical solutions:
- Create simple baselines
- Focus on simple systems
- Prioritise business outcomes

This pragmatic approach has been at the core of the following:
- Building a clinical decision making system used by US healthcare insurers that cover 10s of millions of lives (at [Anterior](https://www.anterior.com/news/anterior-raises-series-a))
- Building algorithms to predict clinical need, enabling the safer delivery of home care (at [Cera Care](https://sifted.eu/articles/cera-biggest-elderly-care-round)) 
- Building the first model to accurately predict blood glucose from non-invasive measurements (at [ZOE](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/30/nutrition-microbiome-zoe/)) -->

<!-- ## What people are saying

#### [Caroline](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caroline-morton-0/), CEO at Clinical Metrics

Chris is a great developer to work with. He listens carefully to the design specifications, and asks questions so he really understands the problem he is trying to solve. He is independent and able to work without much direction, which is essential for a busy founder. -->

<!-- Chris wrote python programs for us. One amplified a dataset of question and answer pairs which allowed us to expand a training dataset. Another program was more complex and involved implementing sentence embeddings into a chatbot system, with unit tests and various bench marking. -->


<!-- #### [John](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndibb/), Co-founder / CTO at Priority Digital Health

Working with Chris was simple and efficient, despite us working on a complicated piece of work. Chris applied an astute understanding of our aspirations for the product, and was able to apply his technical expertise to our needs from a product and commercial perspective. -->

<!-- ### How best to work with me

There are three ways to work with me:
1. **Subscription model**: Includes a 45-minute meeting each week, unlimited email/slack access, and my network of experts.
2. **Project-based engagement**: We will tackle a specific initiative with a fixed scope and budget. This includes helping you do research, write code, set up systems, and anything else you need.
3. **Traditional consulting relationship**: We meet every week to discuss strategy, planning, and execution. I may bring in extra staff.


If you'd like to engage me as an individual, rather than as a company, I also offer the following:
- **Career coaching**: Navigating a career change in the AI/LLM space, particularly for those from a health-related background
- **Technical mentorship**: Understanding technical aspects of ML/AI and how to incorporate it into your current work


If you're not interested in consulting at the moment, I suggest reading my [articles](https://www.chrislovejoy.me/ml4h) or checking out my [course on applying ML to healthcare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj_mF4OlcUY&list=PLZz4IsmMUFBxfuW059IEdqtPuytFG-vae&index=1). -->
