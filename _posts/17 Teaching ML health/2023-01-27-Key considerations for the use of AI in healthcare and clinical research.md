I published [an article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8966801/) about key considerations for using AI in healthcare and clinical research. The key points from the article are:
- Medical AI is well-suited to complex input, personalised output and scaling through automation
- However, AI has limitations, and it's generally better to start with a problem rather than a solution. Its limitations include:
	- AI models are inherently difficult to interpret
	- AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on
	- Some clinical decisions are inappropriate for AI
- Both clinical and machine learning expertise is required for medical AI
- Its not obvious how much data is required (although the more the better)
- There is currently no standardised environment for deployment of AI models
- The regulatory landscape for medical AI is evolving and unclear]

Many of these points are also expanded on in [this slideshow presentation](https://www.chrislovejoy.me/slides/key-considerations) (originally delivered as part of [this module](https://www.chrislovejoy.me/imperial) at Imperial College London).
