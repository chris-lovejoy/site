***UPDATE (Feb 2023): I decided to stop at day 16.** It was a helpful exercise, but writing itself wasn't the rate limiting step. I realised I needed to **learn more words**, and I came across an awesome tool called [LingQ](https://www.lingq.com) for doing so - so that's what I'm focussed on right now.*

***UPDATE (Sept 2023): I decided to re-start from day 16. I've spent a bunch of time reading and listening, and feel that synthesising this learning through writing is the next step. (Hopefully there's a noticeable improvement from the first 16 days!) I've also added functionality to my local [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault which automatically generates feedback on my Spanish writing with GPT.***

For the next 30 days I'm going to write 250+ words in Spanish every day and share them on this site.

I'm not reinventing the wheel here. The whole "do X for 30/60/90 days" isn't new.

However, I'm going to take a systematic approach, which I haven't (yet) come across elsewhere.

(context: I'm learning Spanish, am around B1 / lower intermediate level).


## Topic and grammar looping
I'm going to identify 6 topics and keep looping through them. Given 30 days, this means I'll re-cover each topic 5 times. I'm hoping to beyond initial superficial thoughts on a topic - and force myself to reach a deeper level of expression in the new language.

As well as looping through topics, I'm going to loop through:
- grammatical structures 
- styles
- use of translate to find new words

For example, I might focus on using the future conditional on one day and past imperfect on the next. Or incorporating a specific learning point (e.g. use estar vs ser in Spanish). The cadence for this will be different (ie. more than 6 approaches I cycle through), so it'll be deliberately out-of-sync with topics.

In the final six days, I'll focus on bringing together all that I've written on each topic into a final, original essay in Spanish.


## What else I hope to learn

I'm also going to experiment on other axes, with a view to answer the following questions:
- Does the nature of my writing vary when I write directly into Spanish vs when I write first in English then translate that into Spanish
- How can AI best be utilised to support the language learning process? (E.g. Can GPT give me good feedback on my writing? Can it give me prompts to write about?)
- How best to utilise translate? Do I remember more or less if use translate when I can't think of words?
- What is the best type of feedback? Can I categorise my errors? 


## What I'll write about

The 6 topics will be:
- Sleep
- AI for language learning
- Writing
- Work
- Progress
- Principle of learning

## Why do it this way?

### 1. Writing is the best way to learn grammar

I've consumed a lot of Spanish and understand well, but am slow to produce output (both spoken or written). I believe you can learn faster with written, because you can pause and think more - and therefore learn the grammar. When talking, you can often skip on grammar and still convey the desired meaning - and improve less here as a result.

I loved the [Total Language Transfer course](https://www.languagetransfer.org/complete-spanish) and fully believe in the principle:

> Think slowly, learn quickly

(or words to that effect.)


### 2. Sharing in public creates accountability
Even if nobody reads this articles, the fact that somebody *may* just check out this article and see that I haven't followed through can be a powerful motivational force.

Initial inspiration for this came from stumbling across [Jamal's notes](https://notes.soyjamal.com).


### 3. I'll learn words that are useful for me
I'm a believer in learning the words that you're most likely to use. No point learning the names of dinosaurs in spanish if I'm never going to have a conversation about it.

Given that I'm writing about areas I'm interested in, there's a pretty decent chance I'll have future conversations about these topics too.
