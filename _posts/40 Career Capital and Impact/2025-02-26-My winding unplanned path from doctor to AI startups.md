In 2020, as the peak from the first wave of COVID subsided in the UK, I worked my final shift as a medical doctor. Since then, I've worked as a data scientist, founded a VC-backed start-up, been an [[Independent Consulting|independent consultant]] for 10+ health AI companies and now work at [Anterior](https://anterior.com/).

It took me ~3 years to go from "I don't think I want to be a full-time doctor forever" to getting my first full-time role outside of medicine (as a data scientist) and it's been ~5 years since then. 

During this time, I used "high-speed career sampling" to gradually go from a vague notion that I liked "tech and scalable impact" to a clearer definition of what I love and how I can add value.

I found it helpful to:
- **find people 3-5 years** ahead of me on career path and ask them lots of questions
- **take "little bets"** (eg. committing to a project for 2 months - and seeing how I felt at the end)
- **view my professional life in phases** (ie. [don't be a donkey](https://sive.rs/donkey))

I don't believe career paths should be linear and I think everybody should find their own way. I'm sharing my path not because I think you should emulate it - but because I hope my experiences can be a helpful datapoint.


### Phase 1: Investment Banking, Management Consulting
The first routes I considered out of medicine were perhaps the most obvious at the time: investment banking and managing consulting. Back in 2016/2017 there were a bunch of medics doing this, and books like [Management Consulting for Medics](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Management-Consulting-Medics-competition-Accelerator-ebook/dp/B019HVOBNY) with tips on making the leap.

I considered investment banking first, without *really* understanding what it was, because a friend left medical school straight into [LSEG](https://www.lseg.com/en) and was telling me how great it was.

I applied for a few jobs and did a few interviews - but ultimately performed poorly because I didn't *actually* know much about investment banking beyond a few evenings reading [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/).

Shortly after, I considered management consulting more seriously. I reached out to a bunch of medics-turned-consultants and read the classic books. I decided it was a solid choice because working at a top firm would open more doors downstream. I still didn't really know *what exactly* I wanted to do outside of medicine and this kept the optionality high.

I spent 3-4 months doing case interview practice during quiet medical nights shifts and did a remote online MBA. After doing the case interview practice I realised, however, that I didn't *love* it, and it also didn't come naturally. I'm much better at writing than I am synthesising thoughts while talking. It felt like the latter is an important part of being a good management consultant.

So I made the call to withdraw my applications to McKinsey, BCG, etc before doing the interviews - and to consider an alternative path.


### Phase 2: Public Health
I've always wanted a "scalable impact" - and bought into the idea that [your impact as a doctor is limited by the number of patients you can directly treat](https://80000hours.org/articles/how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save-part-1/). Public health, however, impacts populations and so doing good work here can (in theory) save more lives.

I reached out to my local council and spent some time working with them. I completed a project looking at the impact of air quality interventions on respiratory problems. The work was interesting but I realised two things.

Firstly, that being a doctor wasn't a *concrete* value-add in many cases - there were many public health registrars who didn't have a medical degree and still contributed in much the same way.

Secondly, and more importantly for me, that having an impact is very driven by the political mood of the time. A public health initiative with great data supporting it may be ignored in favour of one that has more *political* interest at the time. Therefore you had to be patient and work within the shifting political winds.

I concluded that perhaps you can have more impact up-stream: dictating the agenda and policy rather than implementing it. I'm still open to some kind of role in politics - but I'll leave that for a later phase of my life.


### Phase 3: Programming, Data Science, Machine Learning
Having explored options where soft skills were the focus, I wanted to learn something more *concrete*. Programming felt like a great option.

Initially, I just wanted to *make things with code*, without really understanding the different components of that. I'd heard about data science and machine learning, but wasn't too sure where that fit into building apps.

So I started by taking online courses and building projects (more details [[Beginner to Data Scientist in 25 months: Every Project and What IÂ Learnt|here]]).

I came to realise the relevance and value of data science and machine learning in healthcare, so increasingly leant into that. I loved the need to combine maths and code. The introvert in me embraced the fact I could sit in a room and work on projects for weeks and months. In medicine, you see new patients every day. With projects, you can work on the same thing for a sustained period and have *built something cool* by the end of it.

This was the avenue I enjoyed the most, so my little bets (ie. projects) led to bigger bets: I enrolled in a tough Master's degree (Data Science and Machine Learning MSc) at University College London then started my first full-time technical job as a data scientist.


### Phase 4: Teaching, Content Creation, Courses
I've always enjoyed teaching -- as a mechanism to consolidate my own understanding, while helping others. I'd taught basic sciences at Cambridge University as well as English as a foreign language at various universities in Japan and South Korea.

So I decided to try make a career out of this. Throughout 2020, I wrote educational content online, made YouTube videos and ran in-person courses.

This was a lot of fun, and I started to see some modest success. I gained guest lecturer positions at UCL and [[Imperial Course|Imperial College London]], and my YouTube following grew to ~9,000 followers.

However, I found the overhead of "packaging up ideas" to be time-consuming -- and worried about spending more time *teaching* than actually *doing*. (Maybe [[Can LLMs make idea-sharing truly frictionless?|this is easier now]].) I had a solid grasp of the concepts I was teaching but felt like I hadn't truly *built* something cool with them yet. Which led me to my next phase:


### Phase 5: Start-Ups
By the end of 2020, I felt I'd developed a critical base skillset and now wanted to *build* something. Starting a VC-backed company seemed to be the way to go, so I joined the [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com/) accelerator and created "Billions Health".

I pivoted through a bunch of ideas for around a year, centred around enabling large scale machine learning using health data, but then ultimately decided to call it a day.

By that point, I had begun to question whether the VC-backed route should be the default choice and also whether you should start with a co-founder. I read Peter Level's book ["Make"](https://readmake.com/) and spent 8 months doing (i) independent consulting to build up my savings and (ii) hacking on my own potential business ideas.

I was determined to keep going until something popped off and was convinced I'd get there eventually. But then a friend reached out with a great opportunity: LLMs were popping off, he'd found a great early use case in healthcare and was raising some initial investment. Given how strongly this aligned with my background and interests, I decided to put my own thing on pause and give it a shot. This later became [Anterior](https://anterior.com/) - and it's where I work today.


### Reflections
I'm very happy with how things played out, and where I am now, although I never really *planned* any of this out. I just followed curiosity and built skills I hoped would be valuable. I learnt to program, for example, without a concrete plan of what I'd *do* with it - or even being sure there was a job that existed for my combination of skills. (I'm not saying I would recommend this!)

I do still have the sensation that I've not progressed *quickly* enough. All of this has taken years. Perhaps there was a more direct route I could have followed to achieve similar ends. But on the flip side, I've built a pretty esoteric set of skills which I hope will enable a career path that, although unconventional, is deeply enjoyable and adapted to my interests. In that regard, I feel like I'm just getting started.
