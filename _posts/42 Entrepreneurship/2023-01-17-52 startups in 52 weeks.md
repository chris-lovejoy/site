**This year I'm setting the goal of launching 52 startups in 52 weeks.**

--

***UPDATE: I actually think this is a bad idea**. It's encouraging me to rush things, and not got deep enough on any particular product to make something meaningful.*

*Therefore, I've decided to switch to 12 startups in 12 months. That's a pretty solid timeframe for shipping things - still long enough to work on it, whilst not so short that you stay superficial.*

*But now, back to the original article:*

Pieter Levels ([levels.io](https://twitter.com/levelsio)) [did something similar](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/) in 2014. He set himself the goal of launching 12 startups in 12 months. During the first few months, he created [NomadList](https://nomadlist.com) and [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.com), both of which are still running and used today.

I'm going for 52 because:
- I want to really push myself to ship stuff continuously
- It feels (slightly) more original than going for 12 in 12 months
- I'm pretty much full-time on this, so don't really have an excuse

### But 52 start-ups? Isn't that crazy / impossible?

Well... yes, probably. But let's clarify what I mean here by "start-ups". In reality I'm talking about **projects which could become start-ups**. The intention from day 1 for each project is to monetise it and turn it into a start-up. However, (as with "true" start-ups), there's a fair chance that most of them will fail. Also, "52 projects in 52 weeks" is too boring... so yes, part of this is framing ðŸ™ƒ.

Pieter [defines a startup](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/) quite broadly as:
> A startup delivers a new product and grows it fast

(Check out his article for more context.)


### Progress Report

**Week 0 (2nd Jan - 8th Jan)**: I came up with the *idea* of the 52 startups. I was still on holiday and didn't *truly* ship anything, so not counting this week towards the 52.

**Week 1 (9th Jan - 15th Jan)**: I launched [CheckMyWriting.com](https://checkmyforeignwriting.com/). I summarised my learnings [here](/check-my-writing).

**Week 2 (16th - 22nd Jan)**: I launched my personal website (www.chrislovejoy.me). (Stretching the 'startup' idea here.. but I do hope to monetise this site at some point, and I spent 30+ hours on this, so didn't have time to ship much else.)

**Week 3 (23rd Jan - 29th Jan)**: I started to build a chatGPT-derived tweet-thread generator, but decided against it because it's a pretty crowded space (and I'm not that passionate about viral tweet threads).
