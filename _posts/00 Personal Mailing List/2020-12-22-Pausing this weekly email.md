#### **TL;DR**

I’m committing to _not_ writing weekly emails or making YouTube videos until atleast mid-2021. I’m also strictly reducing content consumption. Basically, I’m [switching from output to input](https://buttondown.email/ChrisLovejoy/archive/how-to-make-the-most-of-free-moments/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email). I’m going to be focussed on a few specific areas.

(I’ll still be checking my emails, so feel free to stay in touch.)


#### The plans I made

This year, I decided to make sharing and learning in public a priority. I’m in a transition period (as a doctor diving into machine learning and data science) and decided to share my thoughts, reflections and experiences.

I reflected on mediums through which to do this at the end of last year, and opted for:

- Weekly writing ✅
- YouTube videos ✅
- Podcasts ❌
- Other ❌

I shared my rationale for the weekly email, which was basically (i) commit to weekly to build the writing habit, (ii) make it public to ensure I put in the effort and (iii) encourage myself to stop and reflect.

A month in I added another condition: [to avoid superficiality](https://buttondown.email/ChrisLovejoy/archive/avoiding-superficiality-the-future-of-this-weekly/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email) by writing on larger topics as a series of smaller emails.

Alongside this, I committed to making one YouTube video a week. I played around with various different ‘types’ of video, including vlogs, educational videos and reflections.


#### How it went

I wrote several email series:

- Being productive as a parent: [1](https://buttondown.email/ChrisLovejoy/archive/never-writing-ourselves-off-productivity-lessons/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email), [2](https://buttondown.email/ChrisLovejoy/archive/matching-tasks-to-moments-a-method-to-maximise/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email), [3](https://buttondown.email/ChrisLovejoy/archive/strategies-for-sleeping-less-lessons-from/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email), [4](https://buttondown.email/ChrisLovejoy/archive/the-benefits-of-breaking-routines/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email)
    
- AI in healthcare: [1](https://buttondown.email/ChrisLovejoy/archive/machine-learning-in-medicine-in-the-2020s-my/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email), [2](https://buttondown.email/ChrisLovejoy/archive/artificial-intelligence-in-drug-discovery/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email), [3](https://buttondown.email/ChrisLovejoy/archive/will-ai-replace-doctors/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email), [4](https://buttondown.email/ChrisLovejoy/archive/what-can-doctors-do-that-ai-cant/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email)
    
- Transitioning into data science / learning to code: [1](https://buttondown.email/ChrisLovejoy/archive/finding-and-learning-from-technical-mentors/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email), [2](https://buttondown.email/ChrisLovejoy/archive/building-a-project-portfolio/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email), [3](https://buttondown.email/ChrisLovejoy/archive/should-i-go-on-a-project-based-course-bootcamp/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email), [4](https://buttondown.email/ChrisLovejoy/archive/3-routes-to-combine-machine-learning-with-domain/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email), [5](https://buttondown.email/ChrisLovejoy/archive/every-coding-project-i-ever-did-and-what-i-learnt/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email), [6](https://buttondown.email/ChrisLovejoy/archive/6-reasons-to-learn-coding-through-projects/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email)
    
- Project for life automation: [1](https://chrislovejoy.me/job-scraper/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email), [2](https://towardsdatascience.com/i-created-my-own-youtube-algorithm-to-stop-me-wasting-time-afd170f4ca3a?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email)
    

I made a load of Youtube videos too (56 in total). Most of them are (respectfully) pretty bad. The only ones I’d recommend are:

1. [A day in the life of a data scientist (during COVID)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y69ma9ad4_k&utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email)
2. [My Machine Learning for Healthcare Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj_mF4OlcUY&list=PLZz4IsmMUFBxfuW059IEdqtPuytFG-vae&utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email)
3. [My Learning to Code for Medicine Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve9Mz58p4VA&list=PLZz4IsmMUFBw-1i7MujDwNoWE2mK4Yt53&utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email)


With the consistency, I saw a slow-and-steady growth rate that gradually increased. For example, my YouTube went from around 0 -> ~600 subscribers in the first 8 months, but from ~600 -> ~2,000 subscribers in the final 4 months.

But far cooler than the numbers, in my opinion, are all the side perks from sharing in public; meeting cool people, job opportunities, interesting conversations, etc.

#### Benefits of learning in public

**Creating content can be great for:**

- Connecting you with like-minded people and creating cool opportunities (which are sometimes hard to predict).
    
- Having an audience to collaborate with. (E.g. loads of great contributions to [ExplainThisPaper.com](http://explainthispaper.com/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email) have come via this newsletter)
    
- Building a business around. Lots of people have done this successfully. (I made a few £1,000s this year, but this is small relative to the time investment)
    

I feel that investing a lot of time into content creation this year has given me a good insight into how I could double-down on building a large audience, and I’m confident that if I put my mind to it that it’s something I could do.

#### Why not focus on creating content?

**But there are also strong arguments against devoting significant time to content creation.**

For me, the biggest trap I want to avoid is creating content for the sake of it. When the focus is on building am audience, you will lean towards create content just because it _works_ (i.e. people will consume it), but may shift away from making what you truly want to make or what is truly valuable. I feel this is particularly a risk when the content is created as a business.

I don’t want to lay judgment on anybody who’s taking this approach, but on reflection it’s just not for me. I already feel that, as a society, we consume too much and create too little. I don’t have a strong drive to be another person creating content for people to consume.

I would rather take the approach of focussing on building something that I feel is more tangibly adding value to the world, and using ‘content creation’ (ie. sharing thoughts and learnings) as a side product of that.

This will almost certainly mean that my audience will grow more slowly than it could otherwise. But personally, I’m happy with that.

#### What next for this newsletter?

If my top priority was to keep growing this newsletter, then I believe the best approach would be:

- Keep posting at least once a week
    
- Focus on a clear audience and ‘value add’ from the newsletter
    
- Double-down on potential ‘viral content’ (like my [YouTube video finder](https://towardsdatascience.com/i-created-my-own-youtube-algorithm-to-stop-me-wasting-time-afd170f4ca3a?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email)), which feeds into the newsletter (I got an extra ~100 subscribers after sharing that post)
    

However, **that’s not my priority**, so this is what I’m doing to do instead:

- **I’m not going to place any constraints on myself around the frequency of posting**. I might post twice a week, I might not post for three months. (My year-long habit of weekly posts has removed a lot of the friction for posting)
    
- **I’m going to deep dive into areas I’m curious about,** and where I believe I can build something of value (likely around the interface of machine learning and healthcare, or technology and personal productivity)
    

- **I’m only going to create content when I have a genuine desire / excitement to do so**, or have something in particular that I want to share.
    

Maybe you’ll forget about me (maybe you already have 😉). But I’m pretty confident that the average amount of value each email contains will be higher. (Which is a good thing, right?)

#### Plans for 2021

At least until mid 2021, my plan is as follows:

- Weekly writing ❌
    
- YouTube videos ❌
    
- Podcasts ❌
    
- Occasional blogs (and perhaps videos) when I feel a strong impetus to do so ✅


Ultimately, my feeling for 2021 is that I’ll add more value to my life by [subtracting](https://sive.rs/subtract?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email).

Stay tuned for new posts, [every… sometimes](https://waitbutwhy.com/?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email).
