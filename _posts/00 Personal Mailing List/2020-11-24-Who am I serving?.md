My approach to ‘content creation’ so far has been to just make and write about things that interest me, and share them with others.

But I’m re-thinking this after being introduced to the idea of a “Content Thesis” (on [this course](https://nesslabs.com/from-collector-to-creator?utm_source=chris-lovejoy&utm_medium=email)).

The idea is to define your approach to content creation with the ‘WHO-WHAT-WHERE-WHEN-WHY’ framework:

- **Who** are you making content for?
    
- **What** will you make (YouTube videos, blogs, podcasts, etc)
    
- **Where** will you share it (Substack? Personal website?)
    
- **When** will you share it (once a week? twice a month?)
    
- **Why** do you want to? And why will consumers benefit?
    

The answer should fit into the following sentence:

> I will make _[quantity] [content type]_ every _[frequency]_ about _**[quality] [topic]**_ **for** _**[audience]**_.

When I tried to define my content for the last half of the framework I ended up with two different topics and audiences:

1. **Accelerated skill and career development for part-time coders**
    
2. **Distilled cutting-edge insights for the healthtech-inclined**
    

It’s interesting to me that I have two distinct audiences (albeit with some overlap). I don’t know whether this is good or bad.
