As part of my on-going quest to utilise the benefits of the internet without succumbing to the adverse effects, I decided to create some personal rules to guide my actions. I’ll share them here in case you may find them helpful:

#### (1) **If there’s a chance it will lead to procrastination, don’t do it.**

At the moment when I am about to do something (“I’ll just check my emails” or “I’ll just see what the football score was”), I ask myself: _**Is there a chance this will lead to procrastination?**_

I find the context is more relevant than the task itself. If I’m really enjoying a project and want to get back to working on it, checking Sky Sports Football probably isn’t going to cost a huge amount of time. However, if I’m really struggling with some writing, or with a piece of code, then even banal tasks can be an attractive escape.

I often find impulsive procrastination starts out as a small task (“I’ll just check X”) which then builds into _**procrastination momentum**_. I find that by asking myself this question before I actually _do_ the procrastination-type task, I can curb the impulse before any _momentum_ is built.

#### (2) Write it down before logging in

There have been many occasions where I’ve logged onto one or another social media account with a ‘legitimate’ intention of sharing something I’ve worked on, but then forgetting it for long enough to get swept up in all the juicy social media on-goings.

A simple approach that I’ve found helpful for this is to write down exactly what I’m going to do before I log in. If I’m sharing a post on LinkedIn, for example, I will have written everything out in advance - so that I’m not typing into the compose box with a news feed below and notifications popping up. I will simply log in, copy and paste, then log back out again (at least, in theory).

#### (3) Save it for later

When I’m working on a particular task, I’ll keep a sheet of paper on the desk within arms reach. When an idea for something enters my mind that’s unrelated to (or at least not a core component of) my current task, I will make a note of it on the paper.

Then, at an appropriate time later in the day, I will just batch process all the tasks that I wrote on that sheet of paper.

So all-in-all, nothing super ground breaking. Mostly just small habits that I’ve found have reliably reduced my probability of impulsive internet-based procrastination.

I’m definite not ‘there’ yet with this and am still looking for ways to improve. I would genuinely be really interested to hear what sorts of things you have tried or found helpful, any recommended books or blogs you may have, so feel free to reply.
