I feel like there’s a lot of pressure these days to share things.

Facebook, Twitter, YouTube etc are built around the idea of people sharing their thoughts, opinions and experiences with others.

And from where I’m sitting, it seems like the whole ‘content creator side hustle’ has definitely hit mainstream.

As a ‘content creator’ of sorts, I feel a definite pressure to keep on making things to share. With all the voices on the internet, it feels like you won’t get noticed unless you keep making enough things to gain and maintain people’s attention.

The conventional wisdom for anybody trying to build an internet following, on whatever platform, is that **consistency is key**. To just keep grinding out ‘content’. And the algorithms of these platforms certainly seem to support this.

But on the other hand, sometimes I don’t really have anything new to say. This week was pretty standard for me and there aren’t any particularly novel insights that come to mind.

I could easily churn out something fairly superficial, perhaps re-hash some old internet wisdom, but I don’t really want to say something that I haven’t thought that much about.

And I hope that, in a context that seems driven towards sharing more, choosing not to do so can also be okay.
