Our education system encourages us to “learn lots about X” before actually doing anything with the knowledge. We’ll spend a term in math’s class learning about differential equations. Then, maybe, we’ll study a subject (such as machine learning) where we see some real-world applications of that theory.

This creates the following habit in learning:

1. Decide to learn about X
2. Spend lots of time reading theory about X
3. Think about some projects that apply that theory
    

I’m a big proponent of the reverse approach:

1. Think of a project
2. Figure out what you need to know for the first step
3. Go and learn it
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the next step
    

Of course, there is some benefit in having a basic insight into the area of the desired project, so that we can think of a good project idea. But that comes with experience.

### **📈** What do you gain?

This approach is way more efficient. We’re not spending time learning things we’ll never use. Plus, we’ll remember much more of what we learn if we use it. And, if we’re lucky, we may actually make something useful.

This also makes it much easier for us to get started. We’re not overburdened by what we need to know first. We can just start.

From experience, it can be uncomfortable at times. There’s an urge to stop and just read more theory. But I think this zone of discomfort is where the real learning takes place.

This is one reason I love hackathons. You’re forced to just start making something. You think of the project first, then learn what you need to make it. It can be uncomfortable but you push through. And you just have fun with it.
